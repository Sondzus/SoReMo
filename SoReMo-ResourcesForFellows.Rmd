# Introductory presentation 

Here is a guideline to what to present during your first presentation at the [Forum](www.soremo.org/forum): 

* What is the project about? 
* Who are the stakeholders? 
* Who are the participants? 
* Why is the project important? 
* What are the potential impacts?
* What method do you think you will be using? 
  * "Think" because this initial presentation is an *opportunity* for various faculty and subject matter experts (SMEs) to plug in, get involved, reach out to you, and offer guidance in a technical are that you project may benefit from utilizing. 
  
## Objective 
  In the first presentation,  your job is describe the idea, motivation, and basic proposal, and the rest of the semester you'll work with mentors and experts who will help you along. 
  
## Slides templates
You may, but don't have to, use [this IIT Google slides template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sjW_eok8G-ni3uiZGfMRXkl6rVlqY-igvlhaEp9A3uM/edit?usp=sharing) for your presentation. 
If you are curious you can view two of the intro slides here: ***COMING SOON***

  
  
# Final presentation dry-runs 

This presentation is a 'warm-up' for the final one, and  only  Illinois Tech participants will be invited.  Others only if they are critical advisors and you and/or they feel like they need to be present. 

Thus, there is less of a need to motivate the project again. You may assume everyone who is in the audience has seen your initial presentation. 
At the same time, keep in mind it's been a couple of months, so do have a slide that overviews the problem setup again. 

Here are the main questions to address: 

> 
* What problem was I solving and why? 
* Topic, area, major, methods, findings? 
* What issue related to social justice or equity was proposed to be solved or addressed? How? 
* What issue related to social justice or equity was not solved or addressed? Why? 


In a nutshell, your job during this presentation is to discuss issues, challenges, solutions, roadblocks, innovative ideas etc. that come out of the completed project, to this broad, multidisciplinary audience. 

## Objective 

* Obtain any last-minute feedback, get any possible red flags raised now, *before* the final-final public presentation. 
* Ensure that core SoReMo faculty have no fundamental questions they feel are unanswered at the end.
* Practice delivering the final presentation. 



# Final presentation - a public event 

This event will be open to the public. It is our goal to have as many external attendees as possible. 
## Objectives

By showcasing your completed work in the context of this program and reflecting on what you've done throughout the semester, we aim to:
* Highlight your amazing work;
* Inspire future student projects;
* Invite future (corporate/government/NGO/academic) partners;
* Spark new ideas for collaboration. 


## What to put in your slides 

Here are the main questions to address in your presentation: 

> 
* What problem was I solving and why? 
* Topic, area, major, methods, findings? 
* What issue related to social justice or equity was proposed to be solved or addressed? How? 
* What issue related to social justice or equity was not solved or addressed? Why? 
* What additional interdisciplinary approaches would the project have benefited from $\leftarrow$ utilize feedback from SMEs to answer this, if appropriate.  
* Identify future developments, start-ups, community benefits that can be taken one step further.

> **COMING SOON**

**Tip**: Make sure you boil down the technical challenges from their field to be understandable by everyone. 





#  Technical report 

> **More info coming soon**

## Tasks
* Write
* Review


Work on technical report, engage with other participants, collaborate 
Peer review of other students’ presentations and tech reports

The technical report for the project focusing on So.Re., including key issues that have been / remain to be addressed (from the point of view of project extension / future work), will be submitted, reviewed, and published in our SoReMo Journal.  

## Objectives
Think of this as a solution blueprint that could, one day, be turned into a product (with help of Kaplan Institute program? Faculty & students jointly). 
Also think of it as an exercise in academic writing for a general audience. 

## Structure
sections in your document.  coming soon. 

## Formatting
template - .md or .tex, if those are your choices. coming soon.

# Appendix 

> What is the format of this document?

This document  was created using `R Markdown`. You can read more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and check out a [cheat sheet here](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf), which will guide you through installing RStudio, and from there the moment you create  a new `.Rmd` document, it will be a  working template to start from.  If you are used to using `LaTeX`, no worries: it can be embedded into `Markdown`, with overall simpler formatting. I hope you find this useful! 

## Notes
This document is work in progress. The first iteration was made to help the inaugural class of fellows
prepare for final presentation & project reports.
